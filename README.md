# MaskMonitor

Mask Monitor is an automated solution to validate customer's masks. 

# Inspiration
We wanted to learn something related to ML/AI as we all thought it was an interesting topic we can learn for QHacks and we also wanted to tackle an issue related to the current pandemic, so we decided to make a website for business monitors to monitor if customers are wearing masks properly. We decided to use Tensorflow and OpenCV along with Flask to tackle these issues and create a website. Now, business owners can track who's wearing a mask properly depending on where they set up their camera and monitor it from a single website, making it much easier monitor potential exposure to COVID-19 in their business!

# Features

* Detects if user is wearing a mask, wearing a mask incorrectly, or not wearing a mask at all from webcam or uploaded video
* Displays live webcam footage on home page
* Allows users to upload their own videos and download them with detected masks and violations
