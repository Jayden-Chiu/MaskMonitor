# MaskMonitor

Mask Monitor is an automated solution to validate customer's masks. 

# Inspiration
With the COVID-19 pandemic happening, wearing masks have become essential when going out to public places. With Mask Monitor, businesses can detect whether or not customers are wearing their masks correctly to ensure the safety of customers and employees. 

# Features

Users can use their live webcam footage or upload an video and Mask Monitor will detect and output if a person:
* Has their mask on correctly (Green Square)
* Has their mask on incorrectly (Blue Square)
* Has no mask on at all (Red Square)
